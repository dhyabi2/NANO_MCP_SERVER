## 📝 Changes Made to README

### 1. **Added Production Server URL Section (Top of README)**

**Location:** Immediately after the title, before Quick Start

**Content:**
```markdown
## 🌐 Production Server URL

**USE THIS URL:** `https://nano-mcp.replit.app`

**All requests go to:** `https://nano-mcp.replit.app` (POST requests with JSON-RPC 2.0 format)

**Quick Example:**
curl -X POST https://nano-mcp.replit.app \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}'
```

**Why:** AI agents see the production URL immediately, before any other instructions.
